Project Explanation:

Flow:
The Railway Reservation System is a web-based application that simplifies train ticket booking and management of train schedules and reservations. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system has two main roles: users and administrators.

Users: Users can access the system to perform tasks like searching for train schedules, booking tickets, selecting seats, making payments, and managing their reservations.

Administrators: Administrators have access to more advanced features, such as managing train schedules, adding or modifying trains, handling reservations, and overseeing user accounts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

End Users:

The end users are passengers who want to book train tickets, as well as railway staff responsible for managing reservations and train operations.

Objective:

The main objective is to offer an efficient booking process for passengers, provide real-time train information, secure passenger data, and improve the overall user experience.

Ideas:

Implement an intuitive user interface, integrate with payment gateways, offer real-time updates, dynamic pricing, multiple languages, and accessibility features.

Roles and Functionalities:

Users can register, log in, search for trains, book tickets, make payments, and view reservations.
Administrators manage train schedules, add/modify trains, handle reservations, and oversee user accounts.
This project aims to create a user-friendly platform for passengers to book train tickets while ensuring efficient management and security. Users and administrators play pivotal roles in achieving these goals.
